I. Real Numbers<br>
$~~~$A. Properties of the real numbers and the elementary operations<br>
$~~~~~~~~$1. The Real Number Line, Order, and Inequalities<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. The number line and order <br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. The number line and distance from zero: absolute value, $|x|$<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$c. One-variable inequalities and their graphs<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$d. Generally speaking, whenever we learn to solve a particular type of equation, we <i>should</i> learn how to solve its corresponding inequalities.&nbsp; (Unfortunately, inequalities are often omitted due to time pressures.)<br>

$~~~~~~~~$2. Properties of Addition<br>

$~~~~~~~~$3. Properties of Multiplication<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. Zero has no multiplicative inverse = division by 0 is undefined<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. Unique prime factorization of positive integers (i.e., the "Natural" numbers); factor trees<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$c. Procedures ("algorithms") for operating with fractions; how to find a fractional equivalent of a repeating decimal<br>

$~~~$B. Powers, Roots, and "Fractional" Exponents<br>
$~~~~~~~~$1. Elementary definition and properties of exponentiation for Natural number exponents<br>

$~~~~~~~~$2. Zero and negative integers as exponents<br>

$~~~~~~~~$3. "Un-doing" (inverting) powers: radicals<br>

$~~~~~~~~$4. Fractions as exponents<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. Switching between radical and fractional exponent notation<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. All the "Laws of Exponents" are still obeyed<br>

$~~~$C. The "Existence" of "Irrational" Numbers<br>
$~~~~~~~~$0. Definition of Rational Numbers<br>
$~~~~~~~~$1. The existence of a number whose square is 2<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. The Pythagorean Theorem<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. The Diagonal of the "Unit Square"<br>
$~~~~~~~~$2.  Is $\sqrt2$ rational?  
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. No!&nbsp; If $(p/q)^2 = 2$, then $p$ and $q$ can't both be integers, i.e., no rational number squared equals 2, i.e., no rational number solves the elementary equation $x^2 = 2$<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. Proof: We use a classic form of proof&mdash;Reductio ad Absurdum (Reduce to Absurdity)&mdash;in which we assume the contradiction of what we want to show, and show that doing so leads to a contradiction, (implying that, in order to have a self-consistent system, the opposite of what we assumed must be true).&nbsp; So we start by assuming there exist integers, $p~\&~q (\ne 0)$ such that $(p/q)^2 = 2$, which implies ($\implies$) $p^2 = 2q^2.~$ Without loss of generality (wlog), we may assume that $p$ and $q$ have no common factors, i.e., $p~\&~q$ are <i>relatively prime</i>, (for if not, simply start by "cancelling" these common factors and renaming $p~\&~q$ to be these "reduced" integers).&nbsp; Since $p^2 = 2q^2, p^2$ must be even, i.e., it must have 2 as a factor; but since it is a perfect square integer, it must, in fact, have 2 as a factor twice, i.e., it must have 4 as a factor.&nbsp; Let $m^2$ equal the product of all the other factors of $p^2$ (all of which are integers), i.e., define $m$ such that $p^2 = 4m^2.~$ Then $4m^2 = 2q^2 \implies 2m^2 = q^2 \implies q^2$ is even, i.e., has 2 as a factor, contradicting the assumption that $p~\&~q$ have no common factors.&nbsp; Thus, assuming that there exist integers $p~\&~q$ such that $(p/q)^2 = 2$ leads to a contradiction; so in order for the real number system to be logically self-consistent, the negation of this assumption must be true: it must be true that there does <i>not</i> exist a pair of integers whose ratio squared equals 2.
<br>

$~~~~~~~~$3. Irrational numbers<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. Any number that is not Rational (thus the Real numbers consist of two <i>mutually exclusive</i> collections, the Rationals and the Irrationals)<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. "Most" Real numbers are Irrational!&nbsp; (The proof of this fact, however, is "beyond the scope of this course.")
<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$c. Despite b., between any two irrationals, no matter how close they are to each other, there exists a rational number (actually, infinitely many), and between any two rationals, no matter how close they are to each other, there exists an irrational number (actually, infinitely many): we summarize this fact by saying that the rationals are "dense" in the irrationals, and vice-versa.
<br>

$~~~$D. Irrational Numbers "Behave" the Same as Rationals<br>
$~~~~~~~~$1. Simplifying radical expressions<br>
$~~~~~~~~$2. "Rationalizing" the denominator<br>
$~~~~~~~~$3. Solving equations involving radicals<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. Generally speaking, solving even-root equations introduces "spurious" solutions, so checking the "solutions" in the original equation is no longer a "luxury," it is an <i>essential</i> part of the solution procedure.<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. Generally speaking, solving odd-root equations does not have this problem (because we can take odd roots of negative numbers) (but one should still check one's answers in the original equation anyway).<br>
<br>

II. Sets<br>

$~~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. The Cartesian co-ordinate plane<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. The mid-point and distance formulae<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~$c. The Vertical Line Test for distinguishing relations from functions based on their graphs<br>
$~~~~~~~~~$4. Graphs of two-variable inequalities<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~$a. Concept is still the same: we're "picturing" all the ordered pairs that make the inequality a true statement<br>
$~~~~~~~~~~~~~$b. Algorithm is also more-or-less the same: once you've graphed the corresponding equality, choose a point (usually the origin is the easiest choice, as long as its coordinates, $(0,0)$, do not make the functions involved ill-defined, and it's not part of the graph of the corresponding equality) and check it in the original inequality&mdash;if it makes the inequality a true statement, then every point on its side of the graph of the corresp. equality is part of the solution set; otherwise, typically, every point on the other side will be part of the solution set (though beware of pathological cases where either all or no points, or only the points on the graph of the corresp. equality, make the ineq. true.)<br>
<br>

III. General Behavior & Properties of (Graphs of) Functions<br>
$~~~~~~$A. Evaluation of and Operations on Functions<br>
