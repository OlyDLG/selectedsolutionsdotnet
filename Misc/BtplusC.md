Derivation of $B$ and $C$ in $f(t) = \sin(Bt+C)$ (equivalently, $\cos(Bt+C)$) when values of $t^*$ and $t^* + T,~T=$ period, corresponding to known values of the function, are known or have been estimated, e.g., from a graph.

The main thing here is not the results, which you should nowadays be able to look-up online, e.g., on Wikipedia or using Google, but on the processes, both thought and mechanical, by which the results are derived: if you can remember/understand the process, you can re-derive the results "on demand," in particular, when references are unavailable.

Part 1: Derivation of $B$

The key idea here is that, since $B$ affects the (horizontal) scaling, but not the position, of the graph, the "information" about the actual period of the function depends on it, but not on $C.~$ Thus, we can (indeed, <i>must</i>) calculate $B$ independently of $C.~$ Now, if $T$ is the actual period of the given function, then that means what ever the "regular" $\sin$ or $\cos$ function does over a change in $t$ of $2\pi$, our given function does over a change in $t$ of $T.~$ In other words, every $T$ units of change in $t$ for the given function corresponds to $2\pi$ units of change for the "regular" function; but this describes nothing other than a unit conversion, which is effected by a ratio multiplication: given a value of $t$, we need to "convert" it <i>from</i> units of "$T$" <i>to</i> units of "$2\pi$."&nbsp; Now, just as we convert from meters to feet by multiplying the given number of meters by the number of feet in a meter (implicitly or explicitly divided by one meter), we convert $t$ from units of "$T$" to units of $2\pi$ by multiplying $t$ by the ratio $2\pi/T.~$ Thus the result: $$B = \frac{2\pi}{T}.$$

(Note: this only works if one has correctly identified the period of the actual function, so do so carefully.)

Part 2: Derivation of $C$

Unlike $B$, $C$ is affected by both the scaling, i.e., by $T$, <i>and</i> by the position of our reference point, $t^*.~$ The key idea here is to take advantage of known values of the function in question, the easier the better; this is best illustrated by examples.&nbsp; Suppose the function in question is $\cos$ and $t^*$ is the horizontal coordinate of a maximum (i.e., a "peak") of the function.&nbsp; The simplest "input," i.e., argument, to $\cos$ that results in a peak is 0, so, for our given function, whatever $C$ equals, it must be true that $Bt^* + C = \frac{2\pi}T t^* + C = 0.~$ Solving for $C$ gives: $$C = -B t^* = -\frac{2\pi t^*}T.$$  Note, however, that this specific result is only valid for $t^*$ corresponding to a maximum of the $\cos$ function, so let's do a somewhat more complicated example.

Suppose our function is $\sin$, and $t^*$ corresponds to a function value of $\sqrt3 /2$ (this may happen, for example, if the graph is given, and a specific point on it is indicated to have coordinates $(t^*, \sqrt3 /2)$).&nbsp; Problem: within the interval $[0,2\pi)$, more than one argument makes $\sin = \sqrt3 /2$, namely, $\pi/3$ and $2\pi/3$&mdash;how do we know which one to set equal to $Bt^* + C$?&nbsp; Unfortunately, it does matter, because these two points&mdash;$(\pi/3, \sqrt3/2)$ and $(2\pi/3, \sqrt3/2)$&mdash;are not equivalent as far as the "regular" sine function is concerned: the first occurs where the sine function is increasing (with increasing $t$), whereas the second occurs where the function is decreasing (with increasing $t$).&nbsp; (This assumes, of course, that any coefficient out in front of the function is positive; otherwise, everything is flip-flopped vertically.)&nbsp; However, the just stated fact gives us the means to choose, if we have the graph, or other sufficient information, at our disposal: if, in the "neighborhood" of the given point, the function is rising, then we know that $Bt^* + C = \pi/3$, if it's falling, we know it has to be $2\pi/3.~$ (If we don't have this kind of information, then the given information is insufficient to solve the problem.)&nbsp; For the sake of demonstration, let's suppose we've determined that the argument must equal $2\pi/3$; thus, we set $Bt^* + C = 2\pi/3$ and solving for $C$ yields: $$C = \frac{2\pi}3 - Bt^* = \frac{2\pi}3 - \frac{2\pi}T t^*.$$

Recall that I said at the beginning of all this, that the main take-away should be not the results, but the (general) methods; well, just in case the forest got lost for the trees, let me synopsize this general method for finding $C$: first, find $B$&mdash;it's no coincidence that both our specific results for $C$ depend on $B$: $C$ will always "depend" on $B$; second, find a function value corresponding to a function argument that you know gives that value (e.g., a peak for cosine, corresponding to an argument value of 0, or a "trough" for sine, corresponding to an argument value of either $-\pi/2$ or $3\pi/2$, your choice, but examples are endless and should be chosen for the ease of the user) and set that <i>argument</i> value (not the function value) equal to $Bt^* + C$; third, solve for $C$ (and simplify if necessary).&nbsp; Learn this by practicing it (and checking your results), and it should serve you well the rest of your mathematical life!
