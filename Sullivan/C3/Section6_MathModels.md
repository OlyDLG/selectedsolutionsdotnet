__4__) Let $P = (x, y)$ be a point on the graph of $y=\displaystyle \frac1x$.

__a__) Express the distance $d$ from $P$ to the origin as a functionof $x$; __b__) use a graphing utility to graph; __c__) for what values of $x$ is $d$ smallest?

__6__) A right triangle has one vertex on the graph of $y = 9 - x^2, x \gt 0$ at $(x,y)$ another at the origin, and the third on the positive $x$-axis at $(x,0)$; express the area $A$ of the triangle as a function of $x$.

__12__) __Geometry__ A wire 10 meters long is to be cut into twopieces: one piece will be shaped as an equilateral triangle,and the other piece will be shaped as a circle.&nbsp; __a__) Express the total area $A$ enclosed by the pieces of wire as a function of the length $x$ of a side of the equilateral triangle; __b__) what is the domain of $A(x)$?__c__) Graph $A = A(x)$; for what value of $x$ is $A$ smallest?

__18__) __Uniform Motion__ Two cars leave an intersection at the sametime (say, $t=0$); one is headed south at a constant speed of 30 milesper hour, the other is headed west at a constant speed of40 miles per hour (see figure, in the text); build a model thatexpresses the distance $d$ between the cars as a function ofthe time $t$.

__24__) __Filling a Conical Tank__ Water is poured into a containerin the shape of a right circular cone with radius 4 feet andheight 16 feet. See the figure (in the text). Express the volume $V$ of thewater in the cone as a function of the height $h$ of thewater. [Hint: The volume $V$ of a [right circular] cone of radius $r$ and height $h$ is$V = \displaystyle \frac13\pi r^2h$]

__26__) __Constructing an Open Box__ An open box with a squarebase is required to have a volume of 10 cubic feet: __a__) express the amount $A$ of material used to make such abox as a function of the length $x$ of a side of the squarebase; __b__) how much material is required for a base 1 foot by1 foot; __c__) how much material is required for a base 2 feet by2 feet? __d__) use a graphing utility to graph $A = A(x)$; for whatvalue of $x$ is $A$ smallest?
