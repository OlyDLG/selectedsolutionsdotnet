__4__) True or False: $\tan(2\theta) = \displaystyle \frac{2\tan\theta}{1-\tan^2\theta}$ [for all $\theta$].

__Sln__: $\boxed{True,~except:}$ technically*, both sides of the identity are undefined for $\theta = \displaystyle \frac{(2k+1)\pi}4$, i.e., odd multiples of $\displaystyle \frac{\pi}4$; for this reason it is common to say that this is an identity except at these values of $\theta$, or, equivalently, it is an identity "everywhere that both sides are well-defined."&nbsp; However, because it is an identity everywhere else, both sides "become undefined" (i.e., "blow-up" or  "approach $\pm\infty$") in precisely the same way, and thus, you will still get the "right result" from this identity, even at those "problematic" values of $\theta.$

*The text doesn’t appear to "make a big deal" of this "technicality" (at least not in this Section; maybe it does in an earlier Section and expects you to remember), and personally I’m "on the fence" about it, but I want to make the reader aware that some math teachers will care that you understand this little "idiosyncrasy."

__6__) True or False: $\tan(2\theta) + \tan(2\theta) = \tan(4\theta)$ [for all $\theta$].

__Sln__: $\boxed{False, but:}$ how do we prove it?&nbsp; Well, there are several ways.&nbsp; For starters, (we are supposed to understand that) we are being asked if this equation is "true or false" <i>for all</i> $\theta$; so if it is false for one value of theta, then the statement "it is true <i>for all</i> $\theta$" is false.&nbsp; Thus we can prove it false (or, equivalently in this case, "not always true") by exhibiting a <i>counterexample</i>, i.e., a specific value of $\theta$ for which the equation isn’t true.&nbsp; But we have to be careful, because, for the easiest value to try, $\theta = 0$, it is true: $\tan[2(0)] + \tan[2(0)] = \tan(0) + \tan(0) = 0 + 0 = 0 = \tan[4(0)].~$ Indeed, we run into this "problem" for any integer multiple of $\pi/2$ (why?), so we need to try something a little more "exotic"&mdash;let’s check $\theta = \pi/4$: $\tan[2(\pi/4)] + \tan[2(\pi/4)] = \tan(\pi/2) + \tan(\pi/2)$ which is undefined (why?); but $\tan[4(\pi/4)] = \tan(\pi) = 0$, which is very well-defined.&nbsp; Thus $\theta = \pi/4$ is a counterexample to the claim that $\tan(2\theta) + \tan(2\theta) = \tan(4\theta)$ [for all $\theta$].

But in fact this equation is false for almost all values of $\theta.~$ One way to show this, which we leave to the reader, is graphically (combined with an appeal to the periodicity of $\tan$, because otherwise, a finite graph can’t "prove" anything for all real numbers), by plotting either $2\tan(2\theta)$ and $\tan(4\theta)$ on the same axes, or $\tan(4\theta) - 2\tan(2\theta)$, and observing that this expression almost never equals zero.&nbsp; But perhaps the reader tried to prove this algebraically, e.g., by using the double angle formula for $\tan(2\theta)$ twice, and then observing that $\tan(4\theta) = \tan[2(2\theta)]$ and then using the double angle formula to expand this as $\displaystyle \frac{2\tan(2\theta)}{1-\tan^2(2\theta)}$; one <i>can</i> proceed in this way, but given that the denominator of the other side of the equation is $1-\tan^2\theta$ (reader: check this), at best, there will be quite a bit more algebra involved.&nbsp; Instead, observe that $\tan(2\theta) + \tan(2\theta) = 2\tan(2\theta)$ is the numerator of the double angle formula for $\tan(4\theta)$, so we have:$$\tan(4\theta) = \frac{\tan(2\theta) + \tan(2\theta)}{1-\tan^2(2\theta)} \implies \tan(2\theta) + \tan(2\theta) = [1-\tan^2(2\theta)]\tan(4\theta),$$(from which we can conclude that $\tan(2\theta) + \tan(2\theta) = \tan(4\theta)$ <i>only</i> for $1-\tan^2(2\theta) = 1$, i.e., $\tan(2\theta) = 0$, which occurs precisely for the $\theta$ we identified above when we were trying to find a counterexample; everywhere else, the equation is a false statement).

In Problems __12__ and __18__, use the given information to find the exact values of __a__) $\sin(2\theta)$; __b__) $\cos(2\theta)$; __c__) $\displaystyle \sin\frac{\theta}2$; and __d__) $\displaystyle \cos\frac{\theta}2$.

__12__) Given that $\sin\theta =\displaystyle -\frac{\sqrt3}3, \frac{3\pi}2 \lt \theta \lt 2\pi$ and __18__, use the information given about the angle $\theta, 0 \le \theta \lt 2\pi$, to find the exact value of(a) $\sin(b) (c) (d) cos u2sin u2sin12u2 cos12u2u, 0 … u 6 2__

__112__) If $\displaystyle \tan\theta = a\tan\frac{\theta}3$, express $\displaystyle \tan\frac{\theta}3$ in terms of $a$.

__Sln__: This one’s pretty interesting.&nbsp; We start, for algebraic convenience, with a variable substitution: let $u =\displaystyle \frac{\theta}3 \implies \theta = 3u$; then the given becomes $\tan(3u) =  a\tan u$ (this kind of thing is done <i>a lot</i> in Calculus).&nbsp; The result of Problem 65 of this Section (not "solved" here because the solution is in the back of the text) tells us that $\displaystyle \tan(3u) = \frac{3\tan u - \tan^3 u}{1-3\tan^2 u} = \frac{3 - \tan^2 u}{1-3\tan^2 u}\tan u$, provided that $\tan u = \tan\frac{\theta}3 \ne \pm\sqrt{\frac13}$ (why?).&nbsp; Subject to this proviso, we thus have: $\tan(3u) = a\tan u  \implies a = \displaystyle\frac{3 - \tan^2 u}{1-3\tan^2 u}\implies a-3a\tan^2u = 3 - \tan^2u \implies \tan^2u-3a\tan^2u = 3 - a \implies$ $$\tan^2u = \tan^2\frac{\theta}3 = \frac{3-a}{1-3a}$$

Since $\tan^2$ is strictly non-negative, this can only be true for values of $a$ which make the right side non-negative, i.e., to make sure our statement is true, we must solve the rational inequality $$\frac{3-a}{1-3a} \ge 0$$

We note immediately that it equals zero at $a=3$, so this will be one of the boundaries of our solution set; the other boundary is determined by where the denominator equals zero (why?), which is at $a=\frac13.~$ The number line is thus divided up into three intervals, $(-\infty, \frac13), [\frac13,3), [3,\infty)$ and since $a = 1$ makes the inequality false, the allowable values for $a$ are $(-\infty,\frac13) \cup [3,\infty).~$ (Be certain you understand why 3 is in the set and $\frac13$ isn’t; if you don’t recall how to solve rational inequalities, review text Chapter 5, Section 4; also, the graph of $y = \frac{3-x}{1-3x}$ should be "convincing.")

Subject to that restriction on the possible values of $a$, we can solve $\displaystyle \tan^2\frac{\theta}3 = \frac{3-a}{1-3a}$ by taking the positive/negative square-root, yielding the final answer:

$$\boxed{\tan\frac{\theta}3 = \pm\sqrt{\frac{3-a}{1-3a}}, a \notin [\frac13,3)}$$

(Left to the Reader: show that $\frac{3-a}{1-3a} \ne \frac13$ for all $a$, and thus we don’t need to worry about the earlier exclusion $\tan\frac{\theta}3 \ne \pm\sqrt{\frac13}$: it is automatically true under the Problem’s given conditions.)
