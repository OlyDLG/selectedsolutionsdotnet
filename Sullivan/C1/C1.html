<h3>Section 1: Linear Functions</h3>

<p><b>A note about <q>the check step</q></b>: later in this chapter, and then throughout much of the rest of this text, as well as mathematics in general, we encounter situations in which our perfectly legitimate and correct solution procedures <i>inevitably and unavoidably</i> yield <i>spurious</i> or <i>extraneous</i> solutions, i.e., <q>candidate</q> solutions which actually don’t satisfy the original equation. In such situations, the check step is an <i>absolutely essential</i> part of the solution procedure (in order to determine which candidate solutions are valid and which are not). Even though linear and quadratic equations are not of this type&mdash;our procedures give the solution(s) and only the solution(s)&mdash;it is still <q>good mathematical practice</q> to treat the check step as an essential part of solving a problem. I believe in this principle so strongly that I always include the check step as part of my solutions (except when I <q>leave it to the reader</q>), even when it may seem <q>trivial.</q> (At first, when the check step is not required to <q>weed out</q> extraneous solutions, I will set it apart with its own section within each solution; later, when it does become absolutely essential, it will become an integral part of the solution narrative).</p>

<p><strong>16</strong>) Solve \(\displaystyle \frac23 x = \frac92\) <q>in your head.</q></p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: The idea here is that you’re supposed to have reached the point in your mathematical development that you understand that to solve this equation, you need to <q>multiply through</q> by the reciprocal of the thing that’s <q>messing up</q> the \(x\), in this case \(\displaystyle \frac23\), the reciprocal of which is \(\displaystyle \frac32\); and that the thus required multiplication, \(\displaystyle \left(\frac32\right)\left(\frac92\right) = \boxed{\frac{27}4}\), is simple enough that you should be able to do everything I just described <q>in your head.</q> (We tend to agree with this expectation of the reader’s preparation level, but refrain from insisting upon it.)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \frac{\cancel2}{\cancel3} \left(\frac{\cancel{27} 9}{\cancel4 2}\right) = \frac92~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p>Solve each of the following equations.</p>

<p><strong>32</strong>) \(\displaystyle 1 - \frac12 x = 6\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: I always like to begin by <q>clearing denominators</q> and giving variables positive coefficients, which we can do here with one multiplication by \(-2: \displaystyle \color{red}{-2}\)\((1 - \frac12 x) = \color{red}-2\)\((6) \implies -2 + x = -12\); now we add \(2\) to both sides: \(-2 \color{red}+2\) \( +~x = -12\color{red}+2\) \(\implies \boxed{x=-10}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle 1 - \frac12(-10) =  1 + 5 = 6~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>36</strong>) \(0.9t = 1 + t\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Subtract \(0.9t\) and \(1\) from both sides: \(0.9t - \color{red}0.9t \color{blue}-1\) \(= 1 \color{blue}-1\) \(+~t \color{red}-0.9t\) \(\implies -1 = 0.1t\); now we multiply both sides by 10: \(\color{red}10\)\((-1) = \color{red}10\)\((0.1t) \implies \boxed{t=-10}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(0.9(-10) = -9 = 1 + (-10)~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>40</strong>) \(\displaystyle \frac4y - 5 = \frac5{2y}\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: (After noting that \(y\) can’t equal 0), as mentioned above, when dealing with rational expressions, i.e., <q>fractions,</q> I begin by clearing denominators by multiplying through by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, which in this case is \(2y\):<br>\(\color{red}2y\)\(\displaystyle \left(\frac4y - 5\right) = \color{red}2y\)\(\displaystyle\left(\frac5{2y}\right) \implies 8 - 10y = 5\); I also <q>don’t like</q> negative numbers (I know how to operate with them, but when I can avoid it, I do, because it’s just one more thing one can mess up), so rather than subtracting 8 from both sides and ending up with \(-10y = -3\), I prefer to add \(10y\) to and subtract 5 from both sides: \(8\color{blue}-5~\)\(- ~10y\color{red}+ 10y\)\(~\)\(= 5\color{blue}-5\color{red}+10y\) \(\implies 3 = 10y\); dividing both sides by 10 yields: \(\boxed{y=0.3}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \frac4{0.3} - 5 = \frac{40}3 - \frac{15}3 = \frac{25}3\) and \(\displaystyle \frac5{2(0.3)} = \frac5{0.6} = \frac{50}6 = \frac{25}3~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>44</strong>) \((x + 2)(x - 3) = (x + 3)^2\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Despite this being the section on linear equations, the reader should: a) recognize this as a quadratic equation (QE), at least as initially posed; and b) know, e.g., from a prior course in algebra, that (with one exception) QE’s generally require us to get the equation into \(ax^2+bx+c = 0\) form in order to solve them. Thus, we <i>must</i> begin by multiplying out both sides: \((x + 2)(x - 3) = (x + 3)^2 \implies x^2 - x - 6 = x^2 + 6x + 9\), followed by <q>getting everything over to one side</q> and combining like terms: \(\cancel{x^2}\color{red}{-\cancel{x^2}}\)\(- x\color{blue}{-6x}\)\(- 6\color{violet}{-9}\)\( = \cancel{x^2}\color{red}{-\cancel{x^2}}\)\( + \cancel{6x}\color{blue}{-\cancel{6x}}\)\(+ \cancel{9}\color{violet}{-\cancel{9}}\)\(\implies -7x-15=0\): low and behold, it is a linear equation after all, the solution of which is: \[\boxed{x = -\frac{15}7}\]</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \left(-\frac{15}7 + 2\right)\left(-\frac{15}7 - 3\right) = \left(-\frac{15}7 + \frac{14}7\right)\left(-\frac{15}7 - \frac{21}7\right) = \left(-\frac17\right)\left(-\frac{36}7\right) = \frac{36}{49}\) while \(\displaystyle \left(-\frac{15}7 + 3\right)^2 = \left(-\frac{15}7 + \frac{21}7\right)^2 = \left(\frac67\right)^2 = \frac{36}{49}~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>48</strong>) \(w(4 - w^2) = 8 - w^3\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Again, not initially linear, so we have to begin by multiplying everything out, <q>solving for 0,</q> and <q>hoping for the best</q> (though by now the reader should have caught on that, because this is the section on linear equations, all these problems have been designed to become linear at some point in the solution procedure). We have: \(w(4 - w^2) = 8 - w^3 \implies\) \(4w-w^3 = 8 - w^3\); adding \(w^3\) to both sides gives: \(4w = 8 \implies \boxed{w=2}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(2(4 - 2^2) = 2(4-4) = 2(0) = 0 = 8 - 8 = 8 - 2^3~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>52</strong>) \(\displaystyle \frac{x}{x^2 - 9} + \frac4{x + 3} = \frac3{x^2 - 9}\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Begin by factoring the quadratic denominators: a) so that we know from the start what values \(x\) <i>can’t</i> be; and b) to figure out the LCM of the denominators so that we can multiply through by that to <q>clear</q> them: \(x^2 - 9 = (x+3)(x-3)\) so \(x\ne \pm3\), and the LCM is simply \((x+3)(x-3)\). Multiplying <q>through</q> by that yields: \((x-3)(x+3)\left[\displaystyle \frac{x}{x^2 - 9} + \frac4{x + 3} = \frac3{x^2 - 9}\right] \implies x + 4(x-3) = 3 \implies 5x-12=3 \implies 5x = 15 \implies x=3\), but we already know this can’t be a solution (but if you’re not sure, try substituting this in for \(x\) in the original equation and see what happens). Consequently, we conclude that there is no solution, i.e., the solution set is the empty set, \(\boxed{\emptyset}\).</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: How do we <q>check</q> no solution? Well, in general, we can’t (other than, in essence, doing what we just did, i.e., assuming there is a solution, following the consequences of that assumption, and showing that a contradiction ensues, <i>a la</i> that the solution would have to be 3, but it can’t be): no solution means there is no real number (not even a complex number in this instance) which makes this a true statement, so we’d have to be able to verify that the statement is false for all numbers, a physical impossibility. However, we can <q>cheat</q> (or rather, <q>be clever</q>) and get a pretty good idea that we’re right by <i>graphing</i> (using technology) the equation <q>solved for zero</q>: \[\frac{x}{x^2 - 9} + \frac4{x + 3} - \frac3{x^2 - 9} = 0\]and then <q>set equal to</q> \(y\): \[y = \frac{x}{x^2 - 9} + \frac4{x + 3} - \frac3{x^2 - 9}\]If the graph of this appears to never intersect the \(x\)-axis, i.e., if \(y\) appears to never equal zero, then we can be reasonably confident that we’re right (though we can’t be certain, until we learn some more advanced methods for analyzing this type of graph, later in this text). Here’s a graph of \(y = \displaystyle \frac{x}{x^2 - 9} + \frac4{x + 3} - \frac3{x^2 - 9}\) made with the online, Web-based graphing utility <a href="http://www.geogebra.org">GeoGebra</a>:</p>

<p><img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S1P52.png" height="250"></p>

<p>(I recognize that at this point in the reader’s mathematical development, this graph may be less than convincing, as it looks like it might eventually equal 0 for <q>adequately large</q> positive and negative values of \(x\), but in fact, it never does.)

<p><strong>56</strong>) \(\displaystyle \frac{-4}{x + 4} = \frac{-3}{x + 6}\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Method 1: multiply through by \((x+4)(x+6)\): \(\color{red}\cancel{(x+4)}(x+6)\)\(\displaystyle \frac{-4}{\cancel{x + 4}} = \frac{-3}{\cancel{x + 6}}\color{red}(x+4)\cancel{(x+6)}\)\(\implies\) \(\cancel{-4x} \color{red} + \cancel{4x}\)\(~- 24\color{blue}+12\)\(~= -3x\color{red} + 4x\)\(~-\cancel{12}\color{blue}+\cancel{12}\) \(\implies \boxed{x=-12}\)</p>

<p>Method 2: reciprocate both sides and multiply through by \(-12\): \(\displaystyle \frac{-4}{x + 4} = \frac{-3}{x + 6} \implies \color{red}(-12)\)\(\displaystyle \frac{x+4}{-4} = \frac{x+6}{-3}\color{red}(-12)\) \(\implies 3x+12 = 4x+24 \implies \boxed{x=-12}\)</p>

<br><br></p>

<p><strong>60</strong>) \(\displaystyle \frac{-4}{2x + 3} + \frac1{x - 1} = \frac1{(2x + 3)(x - 1)}\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: This we can’t just reciprocate both sides, we have to multiply through by the LCM of the denominators, which in this case is \((2x + 3)(x - 1)\): \(\color{red}(2x + 3)(x - 1)\)\(\displaystyle \left[\frac{-4}{2x + 3} + \frac1{x - 1} = \frac1{(2x + 3)(x - 1)}\right] \implies -4(x-1)+2x+3 = 1 = -2x+7 \implies 2x = 6 \implies\) \(\boxed{x=3}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \frac{-4}{2(3) + 3} + \frac1{3 - 1} = -\frac49 + \frac12 = \frac{-8+9}{18} = \frac1{18} = \frac1{9\cdot2} = \frac1{(2(3)+3)(3-1)}~\checkmark\)

<p><strong>64</strong>) \(\displaystyle \frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 2x} - \frac{x + 4}{x^2 + x} = \frac{-3}{x^2 + 3x + 2}\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: We need to multiply through by the LCM of the denominators, so we need to factor them to figure out what that is: \(\displaystyle \frac{x + 1}{x(x + 2)} - \frac{x + 4}{x(x + 1)} = \frac{-3}{(x + 1)(x + 2)} \implies x(x+1)(x+2)\) is the LCM (and we know that \(x\) can’t equal \(0,-1,-2\)). Multiplying through by the LCM we get: \(\color{red}x(x+1)(x+2)\)\(\left[\displaystyle \frac{x + 1}{x^2 + 2x} - \frac{x + 4}{x^2 + x} = \frac{-3}{x^2 + 3x + 2}\right] \implies\) </p>

<p>\((x+1)^2 - (x+2)(x+4) = -3x \implies x^2 + 2x + 1 - (x^2 + 6x + 8) = -3x \implies -4x - 7 = -3x \implies \boxed{x=-7}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \frac{-7 + 1}{(-7)^2 + 2(-7)} - \frac{-7 + 4}{(-7)^2 + (-7)} = \frac{-6}{49 + (-14))} - \frac{-3}{49 + (-7)} = -\frac{6}{35}+\frac3{42} = -\frac{36}{210} + \frac{15}{210} = -\frac{21}{210} = -\frac1{10}\)</p>

<p>\(\displaystyle \frac{-3}{(-7)^2 + 3(-7) + 2} = -\frac3{49-21+2} = -\frac3{30} = -\frac1{10}~\checkmark\)

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Method 1: \(\displaystyle \color{red}(2.6)(2.32)\)\(\left[\displaystyle 18.63x - \frac{21.2}{2.6} = \frac{14}{2.32}x - 20\right] \implies 112.37616x-49.184 = 36.4x-120.64 \implies\) \((112.37616-36.4)x=49.184-120.64 \implies \boxed{x = \frac{-71.456}{75.97616} \doteq -0.941}\)</p>

<p>Method 2: \(\displaystyle 18.63x - \frac{21.2}{2.6} = \frac{14}{2.32}x - 20 \implies (18.63-\frac{14}{2.32})x = \frac{21.2}{2.6}-20 \implies x=\left(\frac{21.2-52}{2.6}\right)\left(\frac{2.32}{2.32(18.63)-14}\right) =\) \[\boxed{\frac{-71.456}{75.97616} \doteq -0.941}\]</p>

<p><strong>74</strong>) Solve for \(x\): \(\displaystyle \frac{b + c}{x + a} = \frac{b - c}{x - a}, c \ne 0, a\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Multiply through by both denominators (or, equivalently, <q>cross-multiply</q>), yielding: \(\displaystyle \frac{b + c}{x + a} = \frac{b - c}{x - a} \implies (b+c)(x-a) = (b-c)(x+a) \implies (b+c)x-a(b+c) = (b-c)x+a(b-c) \implies\) \([b+c-(b-c)]x=a[b-c+(b+c)] \implies 2cx = 2ab \implies \boxed{x=\frac{ab}c}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \frac{b + c}{ab/c + a} = \frac{b+c}{\frac{ab+ac}{c}} = \frac{c(b+c)}{a(b+c)} = \frac ca\)</p>

<p><strong>76</strong>) Find the number \(b\) for which \(x=2\) is a solution of:
\[x + 2b = x - 4 + 2bx\]</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Substituting 2 in for \(x\) gives: \(2 + 2b = 2 - 4 + 2b(2) \implies 2+2b = 4b-2 \implies 2b = 4 \implies\) \[\boxed{b = 2}\]</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: Substituting 2 in for \(b\) <i>and</i> \(x\) in the original equation yields: \(2+2(2) = 2+4 = 6\), \(2-4+2(2)(2) = 8+2-4 = 6~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>78</strong>) Solve \(A = P(1 + rt)\) for \(r\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: \(A = P(1 + rt) \implies \displaystyle \frac AP = 1+rt \implies \frac AP - 1 = rt \implies\) \[\boxed{r = \frac1t\left(\frac AP - 1\right)}\]</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle P(1 + \frac1{\cancel t}\left(\frac AP - 1\right)\cancel t) = P(\cancel 1+\frac AP - \cancel 1) = \cancel{P}\left(\frac A{\cancel P}\right) = A~\checkmark\)

<p><strong>88</strong>) Going into the final exam, which will count as two-thirds of the final grade, Mike has test scores of 86, 80, 84, and 90; what score does Mike need on the final in order to earn a B, which requires an average score of 80? What does he need to earn an A, which requires an average
of 90?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: (I chose this one because it is an <i>extremely</i> common question students have; henceforth, the reader should never have to ask.) Let \(x = \) the score needed; since it will count as two-thirds of the final score, the other four scores <i>together</i> count as one-third of the final score (assuming there are no other grades we haven’t been told about). Assuming none of these count any more than the others, since there are four of them, each counts as one-fourth <i>of</i> one-third, i.e., \(\displaystyle \left(\frac14\right)\left(\frac13\right) = \frac1{12}\) of the final score. Thus to figure out the \(x\) which gives a final score of 80, we need to solve: \(\displaystyle \frac23x+\frac1{12}(86 + 80 + 84 + 90) = 80 \implies \frac23 x = 80 - \frac{340}{12} \implies x = \frac32\left(80-\frac{85}3\right) = 120-\frac{85}2 = \boxed{77.5}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \frac23(77.5) + \frac1{12}(86 + 80 + 84 + 90) = \frac{155}3 + \frac{85}3 = \frac{155+85}3 = \frac{240}3 = 80~\checkmark\)</p>

<p>Figuring out \(x\) to attain a score of 90 is left to the reader.

<p><strong>90</strong>) A car dealer, at a year-end clearance, reduces the list price of last year’s models by 15%. If a certain four-door model has a discounted price of $8000, what was its list price? How much can be saved by
purchasing last year’s model?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(x\) equal last year’s list price; then the discounted price is \(x-0.15x = (1-0.15)x = 0.85x = \$8000 \implies\) \(x = \$8000/0.85 = \boxed{\$9411.76}\) and thus the savings from purchasing last year’s model is \(\$9411.76-\$8000 = \boxed{\$1411.76}\).</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\$9411.76-0.15(\$9411.76) = \$9411.76-\$1411.76 = \$8000~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>94</strong>) A wool suit, discounted by 30% for a clearance sale, has a price tag of $399. What was the suit’s original price?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(x\) equal the original price; then \(\$399 = x - 0.3x = (1-0.3)x = 0.7x \implies x = \$399/0.7 = \boxed{\$570}\).</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\$570-0.3(\$570) = \$570-\$171 = \$399~\checkmark\)

<h3>Section 2: Quadratic Equations</h3>

<p>In Problems <strong>20</strong>, <strong>24</strong>, &amp; <strong>28</strong>, solve each equation by factoring.</p>

<p>Factoring is an important skill; however, factoring by <q>trial-and-error</q> is not: what’s important is being able to factor by identifying the solutions (a.k.a. the <q>roots,</q> a.k.a. the <q>zeros</q>) of the quadratic <q>set equal to zero,</q> using the fact that if \(r,s\) are the zeros of \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) then \(ax^2+bx+c=a(x-r)(x-s)\) and vice-versa. (Proof: suppose \(ax^2+bx+c=a(x-r)(x-s)\); then if \(x=r, ar^2+br+c=a(r-r)(r-s) = a(0)(r-s) = 0\), i.e., \(r\) is a solution of \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), and similarly for \(s\). Conversely, suppose \(r,s\) are solutions of \(ax^2+bx+c=0\); we know from the quadratic formula that \(r,s = \displaystyle \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\); without loss of generality, let \(r=\displaystyle \frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\), \(s=\displaystyle \frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\) and consider the product \(a(x-r)(x-s) = \displaystyle a\left(x-\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right)\left(x-\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right) =\)  \(\displaystyle a\left[x^2 - \left(\frac{-b+\cancel{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}}{2a} + \frac{-b-\cancel{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}}{2a}\right)x + \left(\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right)\left(\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right)\right] =\) \(\displaystyle a\left[x^2+\left(\frac{\cancel2b}{\cancel2a}\right)x + \frac{(-b)^2-\left(\sqrt{b^2-4ac}\right)^2}{4a^2}\right] = a\left(x^2 + \frac ba x + \frac{b^2-b^2+4ac}{4a^2}\right) = a\left(x^2 + \frac ba x + \frac{c}{a}\right) = \)<br><br>\(ax^2+bx+c.~~\blacksquare\)) Consequently, we will not solve these by factoring; rather, we will <q>factor by solving,</q> using the quadratic formula to solve, and then writing down the factorization based on that result.
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>20</strong>) \(x(x + 4) = 12\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: In order to use the quadratic formula, the quadratic needs to be in \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) form, so we need to expand the product and bring the constant term over to the other side: </p>

<p>\(x(x + 4) = 12 \implies x^2+4x-12=0 \implies x = \displaystyle \frac{-4\pm\sqrt{4^2-4(1)(-12)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-4\pm\sqrt{16+48}}2 = \frac{-4\pm\sqrt{64}}2 = \frac{-4\pm8}{2}= \frac42=\boxed2\) or \(x=\displaystyle \frac{-12}2 = \boxed{-6}\) (which implies that \(x^2+4x-12 = (x-2)(x+6)\), the check of which is left to the reader).</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(2(2+4) = 2(6) = 12~\checkmark, (-6)(-6+4) = (-6)(-2) = 12~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>24</strong>) \(2(2u^2 - 4u) + 3 = 0\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Even though this is <q>solved for zero,</q> it is not yet in \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) form, so we need to start by expanding the product: </p>

<p>\(2(2u^2 - 4u) + 3 = 4u^2 - 8u + 3 = 0 \implies u = \displaystyle \frac{-(-8)\pm\sqrt{(-8)^2-4(4)(3)}}{2(4)} = \frac{8\pm\sqrt{64-48}}8 = \frac{8\pm\sqrt{16}}8 = \frac{8\pm4}8 = \frac{12}8 = \boxed{\frac32}\) or  \(u=\displaystyle \frac48=\boxed{\frac12}\) (which implies that \(4u^2 - 8u + 3 = \displaystyle 4\left(u-\frac32\right)\left(u-\frac12\right) = (2u-3)(2u-1)\); again we leave the check to the reader).</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle 2\left(2\left(\frac12\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac12\right)\right) + 3 = 2\left(\frac12 - 2\right) + 3 = 1-4+3 = 0~\checkmark\) \(2\left(2\left(\frac32\right)^2 - 4\left(\frac32\right)\right) + 3 = 2\left(\frac92 - 6\right) + 3 = 9-12+3 = 0~\checkmark\)

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Begin by <q>clearing denominators</q> by multiplying through by \((x+4)(x-2)\): </p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(\displaystyle \frac5{1 + 4} - 4 - \frac3{1 - 2} = \frac55 - 4 - \frac3{-1} = 1-4+3 = 0~\checkmark\)</p>

<p>\(\displaystyle \frac5{-5/2 + 4} - 4 - \frac3{-5/2 - 2} = \frac5{3/2} - 4 - \frac3{-9/2} = \frac{10}3 - \frac{12}3 + \frac23 = 0~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>34</strong>) Solve \((3z - 2)^2 = 4\) using <q>the square-root method.</q></p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Completing the square is not an efficient way to solve a quadratic, but it is an important skill in advanced math, so I will go ahead and do this one as instructed to provide an additional illustration. Begin by dividing through by 2 to make the leading coefficient 1: \(2x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0 \implies \displaystyle x^2-\frac32 x - \frac12 = 0\); now, in order for \(\displaystyle x^2-\frac32 x\) to be the first two terms of a perfect square trinomial, the constant term has to be \(\displaystyle\left[\frac12\left(-\frac32\right)\right]^2 = \frac9{16}\), so we have to add \(\displaystyle \frac9{16}+\frac12 = \frac{9+8}{16} = \frac{17}{16}\) to both sides yielding: \(\displaystyle x^2-\frac32x+\frac9{16} = \left(x-\frac34\right)^2 = \frac{17}{16}\); now we can solve using the square-root method: \(\displaystyle \sqrt{\left(x-\frac34\right)^2} = x-\frac34 = \pm\sqrt{\frac{17}{16}} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{17}}4 \implies x-\frac34 = \frac{\sqrt{17}}4 \implies x = \boxed{\frac{3+\sqrt{17}}4}\) or \(\displaystyle x-\frac34 = -\frac{\sqrt{17}}4 \implies x = \boxed{\frac{3-\sqrt{17}}4}\)</p>

<p><strong>96</strong>) An adjustable water sprinkler that sprays water in a circular pattern is placed at the center of a square field whose area is 1250 square feet (see the figure in the text). What is the shortest radius setting that can be used if the field is to be completely enclosed within the circle?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(r\) be the required shortest radius setting; from the figure, it should be clear that \(2r\) is the length of the square’s diagonal. Now, because the field is a square, each corner is a right angle, so the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle; furthermore, also because the field is a square, the legs of said right triangle are equal, say \(s\). From the Pythagorean Theorem we know that \(s^2 + s^2 = 2s^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2 \implies r^2 = s^2/2\); but, once more using the fact that the field is a square, we know that \(s^2 = \) the area of the field, which is given to be 1250 ft\(^2\). Thus \(r^2 = 1250/2 \implies\) \(r = \sqrt{625} = \boxed{25\text{ ft}}.\)</p>

<p><strong>100</strong>) (<strong>Physics</strong>) An object is propelled vertically upward with an
initial velocity of 20 meters per second. The distance \(s\) (in
meters) of the object from the ground after \(t\) seconds is \(s = -4.9t^2 + 20t\). <strong>a</strong>) When will the object be 15 meters above the ground? <strong>b</strong>) When will it strike the ground? <strong>c</strong>) Will the object reach a height of 100 meters?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: I chose this one because many students of <q>Precalculus</q> are taking it as a pre- or co-requisite for Physics.</p>

<p><strong>a</strong>) The point of the equation is that it relates a time \(t\) in seconds to an <q>altitude</q> (height above the ground) \(s\) in meters: if we’re given a value of \(t\), the equation enables us to calculate the corresponding \(s\), <i>and vice-versa</i>, i.e., given a value of \(s\), we can solve for the corresponding value(s) of \(t\), i.e., the time(s) at which the object will have the altitude \(s\); this latter case is the problem we’re given in part <strong>a</strong>, i.e., we simply need to solve the equation \(15 = -4.9t^2+20t\) for \(t\) (it is no more complicated than that). We have: \(-4.9t^2 + 20t = 15 \implies 4.9t^2-20t+15=0 \implies\) \(t = \displaystyle \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400-4(4.9)(15)}}{2(4.9)} = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400-294}}{9.8} = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{106}}{9.8} \implies\) \(t = \boxed{\frac{20 + \sqrt{106}}{9.8} \doteq 3.09\text{ sec}}\) <i>and</i> \(t = \boxed{\frac{20 - \sqrt{106}}{9.8} \doteq 0.99\text{ sec}},\) i.e., there are <i>two</i> times at which the object will have an altitude of 15 meters.</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: I will give the check for the approximate answers (the reader should do the checks for the exact answers, i.e., \(\displaystyle \frac{20\pm\sqrt{106}}{9.8}\))</p>

<p>\(-4.9(3.09)^2+20(3.09) = -4.9(9.5481) + 61.8 = 15.01~\checkmark\)</p>

<p>\(-4.9(0.99)^2+20(0.99) = -4.9(0.9801) + 19.8 = 15.00~\checkmark\)
<br></p>

<p><strong>b</strong>) <q>When will it strike the ground,</q> i.e., when will its altitude, \(s\), be zero? We need to solve: \(0 = -4.9t^2+20t \implies t(4.9t-20) = 0 \implies t=0\) (i.e., the instant it is projected upward: not the solution we’re looking for) or \(4.9t-20 = 0 \implies t = \boxed{\frac{20}{4.9} \doteq 4.08\text{ sec.}}\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(-4.9(4.08)^2+20(4.08) = 0.03~\checkmark\) (again, check of the exact answer, 20/4.9, is left to the reader).
<br></p>

<p><strong>c</strong>) <q>Will the object reach a height of 100 m,</q> i.e., does the equation \(100=-4.9t^2+20t\) have any real solutions? This equation is equivalent to \(4.9t^2-20t+100=0\); checking its discriminant: \(\Delta = (-20)^2-4(4.9)(100) = 400-4.9(400) =\) \(400(1-4.9) = -3.9(400) \lt 0 \implies \boxed{\text{no}}\), the equation \(100=-4.9t^2+20t\) has no real solutions, so there is no time at which the object will reach an altitude of 100 m.  </p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: one check is, as before, to graph \(s=-4.9t^2+20t\) to see that it never reaches \(s=100\); but soon enough we’ll be learning another way: we’ll learn (or perhaps you already did in <q>Algebra II</q>?) how to find the maximum value \(s\) does attain (hint: it attains that value half-way between \(t=0\) and \(t=20/4.9\)), so calculating that and seeing that it is less than 100 becomes another way for us to check this result (or indeed, answer the question!)

Since the screen is rectangular, the 50 inch diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are \(\ell\) and \(w\), so we additionally know that \(50^2 = \ell^2 + w^2 = \left(\frac43w\right)^2 + w^2 = \left(\frac{16}9+1\right)w^2 = \frac{25}9w^2\) \(\implies w^2=(\cancel5\cdot 10)^2\frac9{\cancel5^2} = 900 \implies \boxed{w = 30\text{ in.}} \implies \boxed{\ell = \frac43(30) = 40\text{ in.}}\)</p>

<p><strong>Pf</strong>: This statement is only true if \(a,c\) have their usual meanings when the equation is in the form \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), so we assume that is the case; additionally, we assume \(a\ne 0\) (for otherwise, the ratio \(c/a\) is undefined, <i>and</i> the equation is not quadratic, and thus does not have two solutions, and thus it doesn’t even make sense to speak of <q>the product of the roots</q>). With these assumptions, the product of the two roots is: </p>

<p>\(\displaystyle \left(\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right)\left(\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right) = \frac{(-b)^2-\left(\sqrt{b^2-4ac}\right)^2}{4a^2} = \frac{b^2-(b^2-4ac)}{4a^2} = \frac{\cancel{4}\cancel{a}c}{\cancel{4}a^{\cancel{2} 1}} = \frac ca.~~~\blacksquare\)

<p><strong>114</strong>) Find \(k\) such that the equation \(x^2 - kx + 4 = 0\) has a repeated real solution.</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: (I chose this one because this type of question&mdash;find values of such-and-such so that some expression or equation, which depends on such-and-such, has a specified property&mdash;is a common question on mathematics exams, and, in my experience, it <q>trips students up</q> simply because it is new to them.) </p>

<p>A quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), which this is, has a repeated real solution when \(a,b,c\) are all real, and \(b^2-4ac=0\). Therefore, we simply need to find \(k\) such that \((-k)^2-4(1)(4)=0\), which implies \(k^2 = 16 \implies k = \boxed{\pm4}.\)</p>

<p><strong>Chk</strong>: \(x^2-4x+4 = (x-2)^2 = 0 \implies 2\) is a repeated solution, and similarly \(x^2+4x+4 = (x+2)^2 = 0 \implies -2\) is a repeated solution. \(\checkmark\) (Note that the solution to the Problem&mdash;\(\pm4\)&mdash;is <i>not</i> the same as the repeated solutions of the equations resulting from the solution to the problem.)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>116</strong>) Show that the real solutions of the equation \[ax^2+bx+c=0~~~(\text{Eq. &quot;}ac\text{&quot;})\]
are the reciprocals of the real solutions of the equation 
\[cx^2 + bx + a = 0~~~(\text{Eq. &quot;}ca\text{&quot;}).\]Assume that \(b^2 - 4ac \ge 0\).</p>

<p><strong>Pf</strong>: As stated, this claim isn’t precisely true: we must further stipulate that at least one of \(a,c \ne 0\), (because if they are both zero, then we really have only one equation, \(bx=0 \implies b = 0 \implies x = \) any real number, or \(x=0\), which has no reciprocal, i.e., if \(a=c=0\), the claim isn’t true); and that if one of them is zero&mdash;we may assume without loss of generality that it is \(a\), (for if not, simply <q>re-label</q> the coefficients)&mdash;then the claim is only true for the non-zero solution of \(cx^2+bx=0\), namely, \(\displaystyle x=-\frac bc\) (because it can’t be true for the zero solution of this equation, because zero has no reciprocal), which further implies that \(b\ne 0\) (for otherwise \(x=0\) is the only solution of \(cx^2=0\), and not only does this not have a reciprocal, but the other equation, \(c=0\) has no solution, since we’ve assumed that \(c\ne 0\) in this instance).</p>

<p>So we must consider two distinct cases:   </p>

<p>Case 1: \(a=0, c, b \ne 0\): in this case, as already noted, the non-zero solution of \(cx^2+bx = 0\) is \(\displaystyle x=-\frac bc\), while the other equation, \(bx+c=0\), has solution \(\displaystyle x=-\frac cb\) and \(\displaystyle \left(-\frac bc\right)\left(-\frac cb\right) = 1\), so the claim is true in this case.</p>

<p>Case 2: \(a,c \ne 0\) (\(b\) may or may not equal zero): in this case, the solutions of Eq. <q>\(ac\)</q> are \(\displaystyle \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\) while the solutions of Eq. <q>\(ca\)</q> are \(\displaystyle \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2c}\). Multiplying the <q>+</q> solution of Eq. \(ac\) by the <q>\(-\)</q> solution of Eq. \(ca\) yields: \(\displaystyle \left(\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\right)\left(\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2c}\right) = \frac{(-b)^2-\left(\sqrt{b^2-4ac}\right)^2}{4ac} = \frac{b^2-(b^2-4ac)}{4ac} = \frac{4ac}{4ac} = 1\implies \) the former and the latter are reciprocals of  one another; and similarly for the <q>\(-\)</q> solution of Eq. \(ac\) paired with the <q>\(+\)</q> solution of Eq. \(ca.~\blacksquare\)</p>

<p>(Note that we never actually use the assumption that \(b^2-4ac \ge 0\): that assumption merely guarantees that the solutions we are dealing with are real numbers, but the fact that we never actually have to rely on that assumption means that the <q>theorem</q> remains true even when we begin to consider complex numbers in the next Section. Note also the method of proof: instead of showing that one number \(=\) 1/the other number, it was sufficient to show that the product of the two numbers is 1&mdash;whenever it is necessary to show that two numbers are reciprocals of one another, this method will frequently be easier than explicitly calculating the reciprocal of either of the two numbers.)

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: \(0 = x^3 + 4x^2 - x - 4 = x^2(x+4)-1(x+4) = (x^2-1)(x+4) = (x+1)(x-1)(x+4) \implies x+1 = 0 \implies x=-1\) or \(x-1=0 \implies x=1\) or \(x+4 = 0 \implies x=-4\); check: \((1)^3+4(1)^2-1-4 = 1+4-1-4 = 0~\checkmark\), \((-1)^3+4(-1)^2-(-1)-4 = -1+4+1-4 = 0~\checkmark\), \((-4)^3+4(-4)^2-(-4)-4 = -64+4(16)+4-4 = 0~\checkmark\) so\[\boxed{x=-4,\pm1}\]

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(y=(x^2 + 2x)^{1/2}\); then \(3x(x^2 + 2x)^{1/2} - 2(x^2 + 2x)^{3/2} = 3xy - 2y^3 = y(3x-2y^2) = 0 \implies y=(x^2+2x)^{1/2} = 0 \implies x^2+2x= 0 \implies x=0\) or \(x=-2\), or \(3x-2y^2 = 3x-2(x^2+2x) = -2x^2-x = -x(2x+1) = 0 \implies x=0\) or \(x=-\frac12\); check: \(3(0)(0^2 + 2(0))^{1/2} - 2(0^2 + 2(0))^{3/2} = 0 - 2(0) = 0~\checkmark\), \(3(-2)((-2)^2 + 2(-2))^{1/2} - 2((-2)^2 + 2(-2))^{3/2} = -6(4-4)^{1/2}-2(4-4)^{3/2} = -6(0)^{1/2}-2(0)^{3/2} = 0~\checkmark\), \(3(-1/2)((-1/2)^2 + 2(-1/2))^{1/2} - 2((-1/2)^2 + 2(-1/2))^{3/2} = (-3/2)(1/4 - 1)^{1/2} - 2(1/4 - 1)^{3/2} = -3/2(-3/4)^{1/2}-2(-3/4)^{3/2}\) which is undefined over the real numbers, so the only solutions are: \[\boxed{x=0,-2}\]<br>
<br></p>

<p><strong>92</strong>) \(x^4 + \sqrt2 x^2 - 2 = 0\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: \(x^4 + \sqrt2 x^2 - 2 = (x^2)^2 + \sqrt2 (x^2)^1 - 2 = 0 \implies \displaystyle x^2 = \frac{-\sqrt2\pm\sqrt{2-4(1)(-2)}}2 = \frac{-\sqrt2\pm\sqrt{10}}2 = \frac{-\sqrt2\pm\sqrt5\sqrt2}2 = \) \(\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt2(\pm\sqrt5-1)}2 = \frac{\pm\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2}\), or, clearing out the cruft: \(x^2=\displaystyle \frac{\pm\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2}\); now we run into a new (for us) situation: <q>clearly</q> \(x^2=\displaystyle \frac{-\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2}\) has no real solutions (make sure you understand why), but what about \(x^2=\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2}\)? Whether or not this has real solutions depends on whether or not \(\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2}\) is non-negative; since \(\sqrt2\) is positive, this depends on whether or not \(\sqrt5-1\) is non-negative; now, you can type this into a calculator, but you <i>should</i> learn that, given <i>any</i> real number greater than 1, its square-root is also greater than one, and consequently \(\sqrt5-1\) is greater than 0, i.e., positive, and thus \(\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2}\) is positive, and thus its square-root is a real number. Thus \(x^2=\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2}\) has real solutions, which we find simply by taking the positive and negative square-root of both sides: \(x^2=\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt5-1}{\sqrt2} \implies\) \[x = \boxed{\pm\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt5 - 1}{\sqrt2}} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{\sqrt5 - 1}}{\sqrt[\large4]2} \doteq \pm 0.93}\]</p>

<p>Check: \((0.93)^4 + \sqrt2 (0.93)^2 - 2 \doteq 0.748 +1.414(0.865) - 2 = -0.029~\checkmark\) (As a good, challenging exercise in arithmetic, the reader should check the exact answers in the original equation.)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>96</strong>) If \(k = \displaystyle \frac{x+3}{x-4}\) and \(k^2 - 3k = 28\), find \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: We can solve this by first solving for \(k\) in \(k^2 - 3k = 28\) and then setting those results equal to \(\displaystyle \frac{x+3}{x-4}\) and solving for \(x\) (the check will be to calculate the values of \(k\) given by those values of \(x\), and then checking those values of \(k\) in its quadratic).</p>

<p>\(k^2 - 3k = 28 \implies k^2 - 3k - 28 = (k-7)(k+4) = 0 \implies k=7\) or \(k=-4\); now, if we calculated these wrong, we’ll get the values of \(x\) wrong in the next step, so we do an <q>intermediate check</q> at this point (which will obviate the need of checking the values of \(k\) again at the end): check: \((7)^2-3(7) = 49-21 = 28~\checkmark\), \((-4)^2-3(-4) = 16+12 = 28~\checkmark\). Those solutions confirmed, we proceed to solve: \(\displaystyle \frac{x+3}{x-4} = 7 \implies x+3 = 7(x-4) = 7x-28 \implies 6x = 31 \implies x = \frac{31}6\) or \(\displaystyle \frac{x+3}{x-4} = -4 \implies x+3 = -4(x-4) = -4x+16 \implies 5x=13 \implies x=\frac{13}5\); check: \(\displaystyle \frac{(31/6)+3}{(31/6)-4} = \frac{(31+18)/6}{(31-24)/6} = \frac{49}{7} = 7~\checkmark\), \(\displaystyle \frac{(13/5)+3}{(13/5)-4} = \frac{(13+15)/5}{(13-20)/5} = \frac{28}{-7} = -4~\checkmark\), so: \[\boxed{x=\frac{13}5, \frac{31}6}\]

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: We need to solve: \(\displaystyle 4 = \sqrt[\large4]{\frac{L(10)^2}{25}} \implies (4)^4 = \frac{100}{25}L = 4L \implies L=4^3=\boxed{64\text{ tons}}\)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-solve-the-equation-in-C-x-8-12x-4-13-0"><strong>Bonus Problem from Quora</strong></a></p>

<p>Coincidentally, literally the day after I finished the solutions for this section, someone on Quora asked how to solve \(x^8+12x^4-13=0\), which is quadratic in form and thus fits perfectly in this section (as well as Section 10.3, after which we will be able to find all the complex solutions; for now, all we will find are all the real solutions).</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Letting \(y=x^4\), \(x^8+12x^4-13 = y^2 + 12y - 13 = (y+13)(y-1) = 0 \implies y=x^4=-13\) or \(y=x^4 = 1\). Now, \(x^4=(x^2)^2=-13\) has no real solutions, while \(x^4 = 1\) has two real solutions, \(\pm1\) (there are multiple ways to <q>see</q> this; we leave it to the reader to <q>recall</q> them). Check: \((\pm1)^8 + 12(\pm1)^4 - 13 = 1 + 12 -13 = 0~\checkmark\). So \[\boxed{x=\pm1}\]are the only real solutions.

<p><strong>16</strong>) Express the graph shown in blue using interval notation, and as an inequality involving \(x\).</p>

<p><img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S5P16.png" height="100"></p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: The nice thing about this way of denoting the bounds of intervals on number line graphs (it is not the only convention used) is that it immediately translates into standard interval notation: the pictured interval is simply \(\boxed{(-1,1]}\).
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>22d</strong>) Write the inequality obtained multiplying \(1 - 2x \gt 5\) by \(-2\).</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: One just needs to remember that when one multiplies (which includes division) by a negative number, one must <q>flip</q> the inequality: \(1 - 2x \gt 5\) multiplied by \(-2\) is equivalent to \(-2(1 - 2x) \lt -2(5) \implies \boxed{4x-2 \lt -10}\)
<br><br></p>

<p>In Problems <strong>24</strong> and <strong>28</strong>, write each inequality using interval notation, and illustrate each inequality using the real number line.</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: \(\boxed{-8 \lt x}\) (Or, if you prefer your variable on the left, \(\boxed{x \gt -8}\), but the inequalities are equivalent statements.) <img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S5P38.png" height="60">
<br></p>

<p>In Problems <strong>46</strong> and <strong>52</strong>, fill in the blank with the correct inequality symbol.</p>

<p><strong>46</strong>) If \(x \gt -2\), then \(-4x\;\_\_\_\;8.\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Method 1: Since one transforms both sides of the inequality by multiplying by \(-4\), we have to flip the inequality so \(x \gt -2 \implies \boxed{-4x \lt 8}\).</p>

<p>Method 2: Starting with \( -4x\) ? \(8\), to <q>solve</q> for \(x\), we must divide by \(-4\), which flips an inequality, so if the end result is \(x \gt -2\), then the original relationship must have been \(-4x \lt 8\).
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>52</strong>) If \(\displaystyle -\frac14 x \gt 1\), then \(x\;\_\_\_\;-4.\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Again, to get from \(\displaystyle -\frac14 x\) to \(x\), we must multiply by \(-4\) which flips the inequality, so \(\displaystyle -\frac14 x \gt 1 \implies \boxed{x \lt -4}\)
<br><br></p>

<p>Solve each inequality, express your answer using set notation or interval notation, and graph the solution set. (I’m going to alternate between the two solution set representations.)</p>

<br></p>

<p><strong>72</strong>) \(-3 \le 3 - 2x \le 9\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: \(-3\color{red}{-3}\) \(\le 3\color{red}{-3}\) \( -~2x \le 9\color{red}{-3}\) \(\implies \color{blue}-\frac12\)\(\left[-6 \le -2x \le 6\right] \implies 3 \ge x \ge -3\), or in set notation \(\boxed{\{x|-3 \le x \le 3\}}\)</p>

<p><img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S5P72.png" height=60></p>

<p>Partial check: \(3-2(0) = 3\) which is \(\gt -3\) and \(\lt 9~\checkmark\); \(3 - 2(\pm3) = 3\pm6 = -3\) or \(9\), so the boundary points are right; we leave it to the reader to <q>spot-check</q> that if \(x\lt-3\) or \(x\gt3\) then the compound inequality is false (or better yet, prove that we don’t need to, i.e, prove that the checks we’ve performed so far suffice).
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>78</strong>) \((x - 1)(x + 1) \gt (x - 3)(x + 4)\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: \((x - 1)(x + 1) \gt (x - 3)(x + 4) \implies x^2\color{red}{-x^2}\) \(-~1\color{blue}{+12}\) \(\gt x^2\color{red}{-x^2}\) \(+~x-12\color{blue}{+12}\) \(\implies 11 \gt x\) or \(x \lt 11\); check: \((11-1)(11+1) = 120 = (8)(15) = (11-3)(11+4)\), so the boundary point is correct; \(10 \lt 11\), so should make the original inequality a true statement: \((10-1)(10+1)=(9)(11)=99 \gt 98 = (7)(14) = (10-3)(10+4)~\checkmark\); checking that \(x \gt 11\) makes the statement false is left to the reader. So in interval notation the solution set is: \(\boxed{(-\infty, 11)}\), whose graph is:
<img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S5P78.png" height=60> 
<br></p>

<p><strong>84</strong>) \((2x - 1)^{-1} \gt 0\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: \((2x - 1)^{-1} = \displaystyle \frac1{2x-1}\) which can only be \(\gt 0\), i.e., positive, if \(2x - 1 \gt 0\) (make sure you understand why; hint: what is the sign of 1?) so \((2x - 1)^{-1} \gt 0 \implies 2x-1\color{red}{+1}\) \(\gt 0\color{red}{+1}\) \( \implies \displaystyle \color{blue}\frac12\)\(\left[2x \gt 1\right]\implies x \gt \displaystyle \frac12\); check: \(x=\frac12\) makes the expression undefined (so even if it were \((2x - 1)^{-1} \ge 0\) we’d still have to reject \(x=\frac12\)); \(1 \gt \frac12\) should make the inequality true: \((2(1) - 1)^{-1} = (2-1)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1 \gt 0~\checkmark\); \(0 \lt \frac12\) should make it false: \((2(0) - 1)^{-1} = (0-1)^{-1} = (-1)^{-1} = -1 \cancel{\gt} 0~\checkmark\); so the solution set is \(\boxed{\left\{x|x \gt \frac12\right\}}\), the graph of which is:
<img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S5P84.png" height=60>
<br></p>

<p><strong>88</strong>) \(0 \lt (3x + 6)^{-1} \lt \frac13\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Remember that this is an abbreviation for two <q>simultaneous</q> inequalities: \(0 \lt (3x + 6)^{-1}\) <i>and</i> \((3x + 6)^{-1} \lt \frac13\), where the <i>and</i> means that \(x\) is only a solution if it makes both inequalities true at the same time. Now, as with Problem <strong>84</strong>, the first inequality simply tells us that \(3x+6 \gt 0\), while the second one is only true if \(3x+6 \gt 3\) (to see this, multiply both sides by \(3(3x+6)\), which we can do without having to flip the inequality because we just established that the first inequality tells us that \(3x+6\) must be positive), and if \(3x+6 \gt 3\) then it is also greater than zero, so the first inequality is now redundant: all solutions will be found by solving just the second inequality.</p>

<p>We have: \(3x+6\color{red}-6\) \(\gt 3\color{red}-6\) \(\implies 3x \gt -3 \implies x \gt -1\); check: \((3(-1)+6)^{-1} = 3^{-1} = \frac13\), so the boundary point is right; \(0 \gt -1\) so should make the (compound) inequality true: \((3(0)+6)^{-1} = 6^{-1} = \frac16 \lt \frac13\text{ and }\gt 0~\checkmark\); \(-2 \lt -1\) so should make at least one of the inequalities false: \((3(-2)+6)^{-1} = (-6+6)^{-1} = 0^{-1}\) which is undefined (we found the other <q>boundary point</q>), so to be sure, we should try a couple other values \(\lt -1\), say \(-\frac32\) and \(-3\): \((3(-3/2)+6)^{-1} = (-9/2 +12/2)^{-1} = (3/2)^{-1} = \frac23 \cancel{\lt} \frac13~\checkmark\) and \((3(-3)+6)^{-1} = (-9+6)^{-1} = (-3)^{-1} = -\frac13 \cancel{\gt} 0~\checkmark\). So, finally, the solution set, in interval notation, is: \(\boxed{(-1,\infty)}\), whose graph is: <img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S5P88.png" height=60>
<br></p>

<p>In Problems <strong>94</strong> and <strong>98</strong>, find \(a\) and \(b\) (such that the implication is true).</p>

<p><strong>94</strong>) If \(-3 \lt x \lt 3\), then \(a \lt 1 - 2x \lt b\).</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: What we want to do here is manipulate the first inequality to transform it into the second; since multiplication is performed first in order of operations, the first transformation we need to make is the multiplication by \(-2\): \(\color{red}-2\)\(\left[-3 \lt x \lt 3\right] \implies 6 \gt -2x \gt -6\) (remember to flip the inequalities when multiplying by a negative number); next we add \(1\): \(6\color{blue}+1\) \(\gt \color{blue}+1\) \(-~2x \gt -6\color{blue}+1\) \(\implies \boxed{-5} \lt 1-2x \lt \boxed{7}\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>98</strong>) If \(0 \lt 2x \lt 6\), then \(a \lt x^2 \lt b\).</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: First we multiply by \(\frac12\): \(\frac12[0 \lt 2x \lt 6] \implies 0 \lt x \lt 3 \implies \boxed{0} \lt x^2 \lt 3^2=\boxed{9}\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>100</strong>) What is the (<q>natural</q>) domain of the variable in the expression \(\sqrt{8+2x}\)?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: The (natural) domain of the variable is such that the function is well-defined; in this case, the only reason why it wouldn’t be is if the argument of the square-root function were less than zero, so the domain is determined by the condition: \(8+2x \ge 0 \implies 2x \ge -8 \implies x \ge -8/2 = -4\); in set notation: \(\boxed{\{x|x \ge -4\}}\) Check: \(8+2(-4) = 0\), so the boundary point is right; \(8+2(-3) = 8-6 = 2 \gt 0\), so we can take the square-root of it, so points to the right of \(-4\) are in the domain; \(8+2(-5) = 8-10 = -2\), whose square-root is not a real number, so points to the left of \(-4\) are not in the domain.

<p><strong>106</strong>) <strong>Sales Commission</strong> A used car salesperson is paid a
commission of $25 plus 40% of the selling price in excess of
owner’s cost. The owner claims that used cars typically sell
for at least owner’s cost plus $200 and at most owner’s cost
plus $3000. For each sale made, over what range can the
salesperson expect the commission to vary?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: <q>The selling price in excess of owner’s cost</q> is just an awkward way of saying the difference between the selling price and the owner’s cost (or just <q>cost</q>); stating that a car sells for owner’s cost plus $200 is equivalent to stating that $200 is that difference, and similarly for $3000; so for the selling price of $200 <q>over cost,</q> the commission will be \(\$25 + 0.4(\$200) = \$25 + \$80 = \$105\), while the commission for a selling price of $3000 over cost will be \(\$25+0.4(\$3000) = \$25 + \$1200 = \$1225\); in summary, if \(c\) is the commission, then: \[\boxed{\$105 \le c \le \$1225}\]characterizes the implied commission range.
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>110</strong>) <strong>Water Bills</strong> The Village of Oak Lawn charges homeowners
$37.62 per quarter-year plus $3.86 per 1000 gallons for water
usage in excess of 10,000 gallons. In 2010 one homeowner’s
quarterly bill ranged from a high of $122.54 to a low of
$68.50. Over what range did water usage vary?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(c\) be the (quarterly) cost, \(u\) the (quarterly) usage; then the the stated relation between the two is given by the formula: \(c = \$37.62 + \$3.86(u-10,000)/1000 = \$3.86\times 10^{-3}u - \$38.60 + \$37.62 = \$(0.00386u - 0.98)\). Setting this equal to $68.50 and solving for \(u\): \(0.00386u - 0.98 = 68.50 \implies 0.00386u = 69.48 \implies u = (69.48)/(0.00386) = 18,000\) gallons as the low usage; doing the same for $122.54: \(0.00386u - 0.98 = 122.54 \implies 0.00386u = 123.52 \implies u = (123.52)/(0.00386) = 32,000\) gallons as the high usage; in summary:\[\boxed{18,000 \le u \le 32,000}\]was the water usage range, in gallons.

<p><strong>114</strong>) <strong>“Light” Foods</strong> For food products to be labeled “light,” the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that the
altered product must either contain one-third or fewer
calories than the regular product or it must contain one-half
or less fat than the regular product. If a serving of Miracle
Whip® Light contains 20 calories and 1.5 grams of fat, then
what is implied to be true about either the number of calories or
the grams of fat in a serving of regular Miracle Whip®?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(C, c = \) the number of calories in the regular and <q>light</q>  products, respectively, and \(F, f = \) the grams of fat in them, respectively; then we may express the calorie requirement for <q>light-ness</q> as: \(c \le \frac13 C\) and the fat requirement for light-ness as: \(f \le \frac12 F\). So, given that MWL contains \(c=20\) cal and \(f=1.5\) g of fat, the <q>regular</q> product presumably has either: \(20 \le \frac13 C \implies C \ge 3(20) = 60\) cal, or \(1.5 \le \frac12 F \implies F \ge 2(1.5) = 3\) g of fat, i.e., MW has  \(\boxed{60\text{ or more calories, and/or }3\text{ or more grams of fat.}}\)

<p><strong>118</strong>) If \(0\lt a \lt b\), show that \(\sqrt{ab} \lt (a+b)/2\) (i.e., the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean).</p>

<p>For a proof like this, to discover how to <q>go forward,</q> it sometimes helps to start at the end and <q>work backward</q>: we know we want to end up with \(\sqrt{ab} \lt (a+b)/2\), so let’s start there, <q>play around</q> and see if we can arrive at something we know is (or can reason must be) true, and then see if we can start there and end up at our desired location. \(\sqrt{ab} \lt (a+b)/2 \implies 2\sqrt{ab} \lt (a+b)\); squaring both sides doesn’t affect the inequality (because everything involved is positive) so \(2\sqrt{ab} \lt (a+b) \implies 4ab \lt (a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2\); now it is frequently <q>easy</q> to reason out <q>where</q> a quantity is relative to zero, so let’s subtract (which doesn’t affect the direction of the inequality) \(4ab\) from both sides, yielding: \(0 \lt a^2-2ab+b^2 = (b-a)^2\); but this last inequality is <i>always</i> true, for any real \(a, b\) not both zero and not equal to one another, which is true of \(a, b\) in our case by supposition (note that we don’t even need \(a\lt b\), except to make it clear that they’re not equal to one another). So let’s try this as our starting point and see if we can <q>go forward</q> and get the conclusion we wanted to show.</p>

<p><strong>Pf</strong>: Given that \(0 \lt a \lt b\), which \(\implies a \ne b, a,b \ne 0\), it is always true that \(0 \lt (a-b)^2\) (make sure you understand why; hint: perhaps you think we should have started with \((b-a)^2\) because \(a\lt b \implies b - a \gt 0\), but we’re looking at the square, so does it matter if what we’re squaring is positive?) \(\implies 0 \lt a^2-2ab+b^2\); now add \(4ab\) to both sides, yielding: \(4ab \lt a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2\); now take the (positive) square-root of both sides (which preserves the direction of the inequality), yielding: \(2\sqrt{ab} \lt (a+b)\) (technically, the right-hand-side should be \(|a+b|\), but we don’t <q>learn</q> about the absolute value until the next section, so this step is another place where we’re using the assumption that both \(a, b \gt 0\)); take this last inequality and divide both sides by 2 to get the result we needed to show.\(~~~\blacksquare\)</p>

<p>(Note that we never actually used that \(a \lt b\), only that they’re both \(\gt 0\), and not equal to one another, but why exactly did we need this second assumption? Hint: is the inequality still true if \(a=b\)?)<br>
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>121</strong>) <strong>Another Reciprocal Property</strong> Prove that if \(0 \lt a \lt b\), then \(\displaystyle 0 \lt \frac1b \lt \frac1a\).</p>

<p><strong>Pf</strong>: This one is easier than it looks: simply <q>divide through</q> by \(ab\) (which is okay because neither \(a\) nor \(b = 0\), and which doesn’t flip the inequalities because both \(a\) and \(b \gt 0\)):</p>

<p>\(\displaystyle \frac0{ab} = 0 \lt \frac{\cancel{a}1}{\cancel{a}b} \lt \frac{\cancel{b}1}{a\cancel{b}}~~~\blacksquare\)

<p><strong>Pf</strong>: Note that the main reason for assuming \(a \gt 0\) is simply to ensure that \(\sqrt a\) is a real number (and that this assumption is <q>stronger,</q> i.e., more <q>exclusionary,</q> than it needs to be: the claim is still true if \(a=0\)).</p>

<p>Now, \(x^2 \gt a \implies x^2 - a = (x+\sqrt a)(x-\sqrt a) \gt 0\), which implies two things: 1) neither factor equals 0, i.e., \(x \ne \pm \sqrt a\); and  2) either \(x+\sqrt a\) and \(x-\sqrt a\) are both positive, or they’re both negative (this is crucial, so make sure you understand why). In other words we now have that either: \(x - \sqrt a \gt 0 \implies x \gt \sqrt a\) and \(x+ \sqrt a \gt 0 \implies x \gt -\sqrt a\) (the latter of which is automatically true when \(x \gt \sqrt a\)); or \(x + \sqrt a \lt 0 \implies x \lt -\sqrt a\) and \(x-\sqrt a \lt 0 \implies x \lt \sqrt a\) (the latter of which is, again, automatically true when \(x\lt -\sqrt a\)).

<br><br></p>

<p><strong>90</strong>) \(x^2 \gt 16\)</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: This one uses the result of <strong>82</strong> which implies that \(x^2 \gt 16 \implies x \lt -\sqrt{16} = -4\) or \(x \gt \sqrt{16} =  4\) for a solution set of \(\boxed{(-\infty,-4) \cup (4,\infty)}\) (Ditto.)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>92</strong>) Solve \(\left|x + |3x - 2| \right| = 2\).</p>

<p>\(x + |3x - 2|= 2 \implies 3x-2 = 2-x \implies 4x=4 \implies x = 1\); or \(3x-2 = -(2-x) = x-2 \implies 2x = 0 \implies x = 0\). (Check: \(|1+|3(1)-2|| = |1+|1|| = |1+1| = 2~\checkmark, |0+|3(0)-2|| = |0 +|-2|| = |-2| = 2~\checkmark\))</p>

<p>\(x + |3x - 2|= -2 \implies 3x-2 = -2-x \implies 4x = 0 \implies x = 0\), which is a solution we already have, or \(3x-2 = -(-2-x) = 2+x \implies 2x = 4 \implies x = 2\). (Check: \(|2+|3(2)-2|| = |2+|6-2|| = |2+|4|| = |2+4| = 6 \ne 2\), so 2 is a <i>spurious</i> solution.)</p>

<p>Thus the actual solution set is just \(\boxed{\{0,1\}}\), which is confirmed by the graph of \(y=2-|x+|3x-2||\):</p>

<p><img src="./Graphs/SullivanC1S6P92.png"></p>

<p>Method 2: squaring both sides, simplifying, factoring, <q>solving for the remaining absolute value</q> in one of the factors set equal to zero, and then squaring both sides again, which results in a quadratic, is left to reader; note that this method also gives the spurious solution \(x=2\), so whichever way you choose to do it, you <i>must</i> do the check step (or graph it), or you will end up reporting more solutions than the equation actually has.

how much can she lend at the 16% rate and still meet her

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: On $1,000,000, Wendy is required to obtain an average return of 18% per year, i.e., 18% of $1,000,000 \(= 0.18(\$1,000,000) = \$180,000\). Now, of this $1,000,000, let \(x\) equal the amount she lends at 16%; then \((1,000,000-x) = \) the amount she lends at 19% (assuming she lends out all $1,000,000; we’re told that 16% and 19% are the only rates at which she can lend). The return on the 16% is thus \(0.16x\), while the return on the 19% is \(0.19(1,000,000-x)\), and together those must total the required return of $180,000, i.e., we must have: \(0.16x + 0.19(\$1,000,000-x) = \$180,000 \implies \$190,000-\$180,000 = (0.19-0.16)x \implies \$10,000 = 0.03x \implies\) \(x =\displaystyle \frac{\$10,000}{0.03} = \$333,333.33\), i.e., she can lend up to \(\boxed{\$333,333.33}\), or one-third of the $1,000,000 at 16% and still meet her requirement. Check: \(0.16(\$333,333.33) + 0.19(\$1,000,000-\$333,333.33) = \$53,333.33+\$126,666.67 = \$180,000 = 0.18(\$1,000,000)~\checkmark\)</p>

<p>(Note: if it occurs to you that 18% divides the interval between 16% and 19% into two-thirds and one-third, and can infer the result from that, you’re developing the right intuition regarding how (constant) rates work.)

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: If the selling price is $12.50 and the profit is to be $3, then the total cost of a box must be $12.50 - $3 = $9.50. Now, let \(x =\) the number of caramels in the box; then \(30-x =\) the number of cremes; given the stated <i>per</i> unit costs, the cost of \(x\) caramels is \(\$0.25x\) and the cost of \(30-x\) cremes is \(\$0.45(30-x)\); together these must total $9.50, i.e., we must have: \(\$0.25x + \$0.45(30-x) = \$9.50 \implies \$13.50-\$9.50 = (\$0.45-\$0.25)x \implies \$4 = \$0.2x \implies x = \displaystyle \frac{\$4}{\$0.2} = 20\), i.e., each box should contain \(\boxed{20\text{ caramels and } 10\text{ cremes}}\).

12 minutes. How long does it take each printer to complete
the print job alone, and what is the speed of each printer?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Define <q>1 job</q> to be the common 600-page print job, and let \(x=\) the number of minutes required by the faster printer to complete 1 job, so that the <q>speed</q> of the faster printer is <q>1 job <i>per</i> \(x\) minutes</q> or \(\displaystyle \frac{1\text{ job}}{x\text{ min}}\); the slower printer takes 10 min longer to complete the same job, so its speed is \(\displaystyle \frac{1\text{ job}}{(x+10)\text{ min}}\). Thus in 12 min the faster printer completes \(12\displaystyle \left(\frac1x\right)\) of the job, while the slower printer completes \(12\displaystyle \left(\frac1{x+10}\right)\) of the job, and together that equals 1 full job: \(1 = \displaystyle 12\left(\frac1x\right) + 12\left(\frac1{x+10}\right) = 12\left(\frac1x + \frac1{x+10}\right) \implies x(x+10) = 12(x+10+x) = 12(2x+10) \implies\) \(x^2 + 10x - 24x - 120 = x^2 - 14x -120 = 0 \implies x = \displaystyle \frac{14\pm\sqrt{196+4(120)}}2 = \frac{14\pm\sqrt{676}}2 = \frac{14\pm26}2 \implies \boxed{x = 20\text{ min}}\) (because the other solution is negative and thus doesn’t make sense in this context) \(\implies x+10 = \boxed{30\text{ min}}\) and the speed of the faster printer (in more <q>transferable</q> units) is \(\displaystyle \frac{600\text{ pages}}{20\text{ min}} = \boxed{30\text{ pages per minute}}\), while that of the slower printer is \(\displaystyle \frac{600\text{ pages}}{30\text{ min}} = \boxed{20\text{ pages per minute}}\) (Check is left to the reader.)

<p><strong>36</strong>) <strong>Construction</strong> A pond is enclosed by a wooden deck that is
3 feet wide; the fence surrounding the deck is 100 feet long.</p>

<p>For each of these, I’m going to forego providing a graphic, but you shouldn’t: draw a picture.</p>

<p><strong>a</strong>) If the pond is square, what are its dimensions?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(s\) be the side length of the pond in feet; then the side length of the fence is \(s+2(3) = s+6\)&mdash;the length of the pond, plus 3 more feet of decking beyond each corner (draw a picture)&mdash;and the outer perimeter of the deck is four times this, \(4(s+6) = 4s+24\), which must equal the length of the fence, 100 ft, giving us: \(4s+24=100 \implies 4s = 76 \implies s = \boxed{19\text{ ft}}\). Check: \(4(19+6) = 4(25) = 100~\checkmark\) (Since we will need it for Part <strong>d</strong>, we note here that the area of this pond is (19)<sup>2</sup> = 361 ft\(^2\).)
<br></p>

<p><strong>b</strong>) If the pond is rectangular and the length of the pond is to be three times its width, what are its dimensions?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: When doing rectangle problems in which one dimension is given in terms of the other (and not using a two-variable method, which I really don’t like, because it makes one have to do more thinking up front; but that’s the way these problems are being done in this section so I feel obliged to show you how to do them that way), it’s easiest to assign the variable to the shorter dimension, because otherwise its expression involves either a subtraction, or, as it would in this case, a division, and, as I always tell my students, although you <i>must</i> be able to handle division and subtraction as readily as you handle multiplication and addition, that doesn’t mean that, when you have a choice, you shouldn’t opt for the <q>easier</q> way.</p>

<p>So, let \(w =\) width of the pond in feet; then the length is three times this, \(3w\). Just as with the square pond, the three foot deck adds 6 ft to the length of each side (draw a picture), so the perimeter of the fence is \(2w+2(3w)+4(6) = 8w+24 = 100 \implies 8w = 76\) \(\implies \boxed{w = 9.5\text{ ft}} \implies\) length \(= \boxed{28.5\text{ ft}}\). Check: \(3(9.5) = 28.5~\checkmark, 2(9.5) + 2(28.5) + 24 = 100~\checkmark\) and the area of this pond is \(9.5(28.5) = 270.75\) ft\(^2\)
<br></p>

<p><strong>c</strong>) If the pond is circular, what is its diameter?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(d =\) the diameter of the pond; then, once again, the diameter of the fenced circle is \(d+6\) (draw a picture), and the circumference (i.e., perimeter) of such a circle is \(\pi(d+6) = 100 \implies \boxed{d = \frac{100}{\pi} - 6 \doteq 25.8\text{ ft}}\). (Check is left to the reader; area of pond \(= \pi(d/2)^2 \doteq 166.8\pi \doteq 524\) ft\(^2\))
<br></p>

<p><strong>d</strong>) Which pond has the most area?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Having calculated the areas in advance, we readily see that \(\boxed{\text{the circular pond}}\) has the greatest area. (It is a <q>well-known</q> result that, for a given perimeter, the circle is the shape that encloses the greatest area, i.e., of all planar shapes, a circle has the largest area-to-perimeter ratio.)

<p><strong>40</strong>) <strong>Mixing Water and Antifreeze</strong> The cooling system of a
certain foreign-made car has a capacity of 15 liters. If the
system is filled with a mixture that is 40% antifreeze, how
much of this mixture should be drained and replaced by
pure antifreeze so that the system is filled with a solution
that is 60% antifreeze?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(x =\) the required amount in liters; then \(15-x\) is the amount of 40% mix that remains in the tank after draining, meaning that the amount of antifreeze which remains is \(0.4(15-x) = 6-0.4x\); this plus 100% of \(x\)&mdash;\(x + 6 - 0.4x = 0.6x+6\)&mdash;should amount to 60% of the 15 liters, \(0.6(15) = 9\) liters, upon refilling the tank with pure AF; in other words, we need to solve \(0.6x+6=9 \implies x = 3/(0.6) = \boxed{5\text{ liters}}\). Check: \(0.4(15-5) + 5 = 9 = 0.6(15)~\checkmark\)
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>44</strong>) <strong>Chemistry: Sugar Molecules</strong> A sugar molecule has twice
as many atoms of hydrogen as it does (of) oxygen and one more
atom of carbon than (of) oxygen. If a sugar molecule has a
total of 45 atoms, how many are oxygen, and how many are
hydrogen?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(O = \) the number of oxygen atoms in a molecule of (this kind of) sugar (see note at the beginning of the Solution of <strong>36b</strong>, which is applicable here as well); then the number of hydrogen atoms is \(2O\) and the number of carbon atoms is \(O+1\); all together, these must total 45 atoms, i.e., we must have: \(O+(2O)+(O+1) = 4O+1 = 45 \implies \boxed{O = 11} \implies\) the number of hydrogen atoms is \(2(11) = \boxed{22}\) (and 12 are carbon; check: 11+22+12 = 45 atoms \(\checkmark\))
<br><br></p>

<p><strong>50</strong>) <strong>Using Two Pumps</strong> A 5-horsepower (hp) pump can empty a
pool in 5 hours; a smaller, 2-hp pump empties the same pool
in 8 hours. The pumps are used together to begin emptying
this pool; after two hours, the 2-hp pump breaks down: how
(much) long(er) will it take the larger pump to empty the pool?</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: Let \(t =\) the (additional) time it will take the larger pump to empty what remains in the pool after two hours of the two pumps working together; then \(\displaystyle \frac{1\text{ pool}}{5\text{ hours}}(t\text{ hours})\) is the volume of water (measured in units of <q>pools</q>) it pumps in this time; but that amount is also given by: 1 pool \(-\) the volume of water (again in units of <q>pools</q>) pumped by both pumps in two hours, which volume equals \(\displaystyle \frac{1\text{ pool}}{5\text{ hours}}(2\text{ hours}) + \frac{1\text{ pool}}{8\text{ hours}}(2\text{ hours}) = \frac25 + \frac14 = 0.4+0.25 = 0.65\) pools. In other words, we must have: \(\displaystyle \frac15 t=(1-0.65) = 0.35 \implies \boxed{t = 1.75\text{ hours}}\). Check: \(\frac15(2) + \frac18(2) + \frac15(1.75) = 0.4+0.25+0.35 = 1\) whole pool.\(~\checkmark\)

<p><strong>54</strong>) <strong>Constructing a Coffee Can</strong> A 39-ounce can of Hills Bros.®
coffee requires 188.5 square inches of aluminum. If its
height is 7 inches, what is its radius? [Hint: The surface area,
\(S\), of a right cylinder is \(2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh\), where \(r\) is the
radius and \(h\) is the height.]</p>

<p><strong>Sln</strong>: This one is actually <q>easier</q> than all the previous ones, it just seems harder because it involves \(\pi\), but all we do is substitute in the area of aluminum required, \(188.5\text{ in}^2\), for \(S\), and the given height, \(h=7\) in., in the formula: \(S = 188.5 = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi(7)r = 2\pi(r^2+7r) \implies r^2 + 7r - \displaystyle \frac{188.5}{2\pi} = 0\), which is a quadratic equation in \(r\), and solve using the quadratic formula: \(\displaystyle r = \frac{-7\pm\sqrt{49+4(188.5/(2\pi))}}2 \implies\) \[\boxed{r=\frac{\sqrt{49+(377/\pi)}-7}2 \doteq 3.00\text{ in}}\](where we know we need the positive square-root; why?) Check: \(2\pi(3^2 + 3(7)) = 2\pi(30) = 60\pi \doteq 188.50\) in\(^2~\checkmark\)
