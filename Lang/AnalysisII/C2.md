##### Prelude (Chapter 1)

Chapter 1 doesn't have an Exercises Section, but there are a few "Exercises" (both explicit and implied) included in the narrative:

1) Show that $(X \cap Y) \times Z = (X \times Z) \cap (Y \times Z)$.

<b>Soln:</b> $(w, z) \in (X \cap Y) \times Z \Rightarrow w \in X \cap Y, z \in Z \Rightarrow w \in X, w \in Y, z \in Z \Rightarrow (w, z) \in X \times Z, Y \times Z \Rightarrow (w,z) \in (X \times Z) \cap (Y \times Z)$ $\therefore (X \cap Y) \times Z \subset (X \times Z) \cap (Y \times Z).~$ Similarly, $(w,z) \in (X \times Z) \cap (Y \times Z) \Rightarrow (w,z) \in X \times Z, Y \times Z \Rightarrow w \in X,Y, z \in Z \Rightarrow w\in X \cap Y, z \in Z \Rightarrow (w,z) \in (X \cap Y) \times Z$ $\therefore (X \times Z) \cap (Y \times Z) \subset (X \cap Y) \times Z \therefore (X \cap Y) \times Z = (X \times Z) \cap (Y \times Z)$.$

2) Prove: "There may be many maximal elements in $S$, whereas if a greatest element exists, it is unique."

<b>Soln:</b> The reason there may be many maximal elements is due to the nature of the definition thereof, coupled with the fact that not all elements need be comparable.&nbsp; In other words, incomparability might partition the set into disjoint subsets of elements, each of which in a given subset is comparable to all the other elements in that subset, but each being incomparable to all the other elements in the set.&nbsp; When this is the case, each such subset can have its own maximal element.

On the other hand, the way greatest element is defined, we have that if $a$ and $b$ are both greatest elements of a set $S$, then $a \ge b \because a$ a greatest element $\implies a \ge x ~\forall x \in S$ and $b \ge a$ for the same reason.&nbsp; By property <b>ORD 3</b>, this implies $a = b$, so  a greatest element is unique.
